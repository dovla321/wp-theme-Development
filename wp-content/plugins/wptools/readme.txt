If your site is behaving slowly, or pages fail to load, you get random white screens of death or 500 internal server error you may need more memory. Several things consume memory, such as WordPress itself, the plugins installed, the theme you're using and the site content. 

After you increase the PHP memory limit, you can increase also the WordPress memory limit, add this info to your file wp-config.php (located at root folder of your server):
(just copy and paste)
define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '128M'); 

(You can replace also 128M with 256M, if necessary)
Our free plugin wp-memory (link below) can do it for you just with your mouse.
